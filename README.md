`The main goal of this is for the gamemode "Bastion Stairs" in overwatch that my brother showed me.`

`The goal of the game is to go as high as you can climbing stairs, 2d platformer style.`

`The games controls are ctrl(switch directions + jump forward) and space(jump forward).`

`I simply want to make it so that a(turn left + jump forward) and d(turn right + jump forward.`

##### Very simple first rust project!
